rem: TODO 

rem: review the return value from function, now, not as expected.

rem: Distinguish between no parameters, single argument 'nil.
rem: Currently: define with no parameter is represented as single element, Nil, list.

define inc (a,) ; a + 1 ; end inc

rem: eval_fun: name, list of parameters (sym), list of Val (unevaluated)
rem: at exec, define the parameters, execute the list of Vals

rem: use Rc to guide evaluation, because define is evaluation defined
rem: define evaluated, but not afterwards. Done at execution time.

rem: needs to be a value, SYMF
rem: needs to be stored in env
rem: needs an internal env
rem: leave infix support for later?

def max (2, 3) ; call it m

define max (a, b)
if a >= b ; call a r
if false? ; call b r
r
end max

define adder (a,)
define f (x,)
a + x
end f
end adder

rem: returns a function
